# AMLS_21_22_SN18089502
This repository contains my code for the AMLS Coursework about brain tumor detection and classification

## Task Introduction: 

This code allows for detection and classification of different brain tumors based on MRI Images. 


## Organisation of the files: 

The code is implemented in a jupyter notebook. This notebook is divided into two parts. The first part is brain tumor detection (Binary classification) and two models are trained and tested in this scenario: SVM and CNN. The second part of the notebook corresponds to the testing and training of a multiclass classification algorithm. 

## How to run the code ?: 

The first step to run the code is to download the training and testing dataset from the following link: http://shorturl.at/hquDP. 
Put the downloaded datasets into the same folder as the notebook and run the notebook. 

## Necessary Packages: 

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Pandas 
- Scikit_learn
